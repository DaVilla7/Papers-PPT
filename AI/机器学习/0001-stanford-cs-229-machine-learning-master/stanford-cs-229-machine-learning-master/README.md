# Machine Learning cheatsheets for Stanford's CS 229
## Goal
This repository aims at summing up in the same place all the important notions that are covered in Stanford's CS 229 Machine Learning course, and include:
- **Refreshers** in related topics that highlight the key points of the **prerequisites of the course**.
- **Cheatsheets for each machine learning field**, as well as another dedicated to tips and tricks to have in mind when training a model.
- All elements of the above combined in an **ultimate compilation of concepts**, to have with you at all times!
